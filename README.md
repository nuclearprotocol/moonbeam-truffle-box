# Moonbeam Truffle Box

The first release of a Truffle box for Moonbeam. With it you will find a Truffle boilerplate setup to get started deploying smart contracts on Moonbeam quickly.

## Getting started

To get started with the Moonbeam Truffle box, if you have Truffle installed globally, you can execute:

```
mkdir moonbeam-truffle-box && cd moonbeam-truffle-box
truffle unbox PureStake/moonbeam-truffle-box
```

Nevertheless, the box has also Truffle as a dependency in case you do not want to have it installed globally. In such a case, you can directly clone the following repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/PureStake/moonbeam-truffle-box
cd moonbeam-truffle-box
``` 

With the files in your local system, the next step is to install all dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```
_Note:_ We noticed that if you are using `npm v7.0.15` you might have some errors when running `npm install`. To fix this you can downgrade npm to an older release such as `6.14.9` or `7.0.8` by running, for exmaple, `npm install -g npm@v6.14.9`.

The dependencies installed are the following:

-  Minimist  
-  EthereumJS wallet: a lightweight wallet implementation.
-  Web3 Provider Engine: a tool for composing custom Web3 providers.
-  Truffle: this is not needed if you have installed it globally.
-  Moonbeam Truffle Plugin: a tool to easily create your own Moonbeam development node for quick and iterative development (uses Docker).

## Networks

Moonbeam Truffle Box is pre-configured with two networks: Moonbeam Development and Moonbase Alpha TestNet. To deploy in the development network please check the Moonbeam Truffle Plugin section to install and start your own local node.

```
node_modules/.bin/truffle migrate --network dev
```

```
node_modules/.bin/truffle migrate --network moonbase
```

_Note: if you have Truffle installed globally, you can replace `node_modules/.bin/truffle` for `truffle`._

## Moonbeam Truffle Plugin

The plugin is used to get you started with a local development Moonbeam node quickly. You can check all available commands with the help flag:

```
./node_modules/.bin/truffle run moonbeam --help
```

The following commands are available:

### Install
In this context, installing means downloading the Docker image of the Moonbeam development node (requires Docker to be installed).

```
node_modules/.bin/truffle run moonbeam install
```

### Start
Start the development Moonbeam node.

```
node_modules/.bin/truffle run moonbeam start
```

### Stop
Stop the development Moonbeam node. This will remove the container, thus purging the chain.

```
node_modules/.bin/truffle run moonbeam stop
```

### Pause
Pause the development Moonbeam node.

```
node_modules/.bin/truffle run moonbeam pause
```

### Unpause
Unpause the development Moonbeam node.

```
node_modules/.bin/truffle run moonbeam unpause
```

### Status
Shows the status of the development Moonbeam node.

```
node_modules/.bin/truffle run moonbeam status
```

### Remove
Removes the Docker image of the Moonbeam development node.

```
node_modules/.bin/truffle run moonbeam remove
```

## Truffle Plugin Verify

As a convenience, the [`truffle-plugin-verify`](https://github.com/rkalis/truffle-plugin-verify) plugin has also been included in the Moonbeam Truffle Box. You can use this plugin to verify smart contracts automatically on [Moonscan](https://moonscan.io). For more information on how to use the plugin with Moonbeam, you can checkout the [Using the Truffle Verify Plugin](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/tools/verify-contracts/etherscan-plugins/#using-the-truffle-verify-plugin) section of the Moonbeam documentation.
